AP Calculus BC is an introductory college-level calculus course. Students cultivate their understanding of differential and integral calculus through engaging with real-world problems represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally and using definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions as they explore concepts like change, limits, and the analysis of functions. Anna, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are engaged, adaptable, independent. Anna, you sometimes turn in homework, and I think you would benefit from doing the homework more often because it would help you deepen your understanding of the course material. You work better on an individual basis, I see that you are sometimes hesitant to share your ideas infront of the class, but you still have wonderful ideas. You could work on opening up and sharing your great ideas in class . I look forward to seeing your growth in participation. Anna, you have struggled a lot in this class, even to a point where I would recommend you consider switching to an easier class. Your test scores are very poor, scoring below C's on most tests, and getting a 60 on the final. If you choose to continue in this class, I would like to set up daily meetings with you to help you relearn all the content. The jump in difficulty from Honors Precalc to Calc BC is quite significant. As a reflection of the work you turned in, you recieve a final grade of C, I reccomend you have a chat with your advisor and me to craft a plan for better performance in the future.
