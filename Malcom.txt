AP Calculus BC is an introductory college-level calculus course. Students cultivate their understanding of differential and integral calculus through engaging with real-world problems represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally and using definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions as they explore concepts like change, limits, and the analysis of functions. Malcom, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are engaged, disciplined, collaborative. Malcom, you always turn in homework, and I applaud your dedication to the course! You work very well in small and large groups, I see that you are excited to share your ideas infront of the class. I think you are a stellar example of what participation should look like in class.Malcom, you have done very well in this class, scoring A's on most tests, and getting an 97 on the final. You show an extremely high level of skill, and I look forward to seeing how you will progress further. If you are looking for an extra challenge, feel free to stop by my office and ask for some extra practice problems. The jump from Honors Precalc to Calc BC is significant and you have done well in this transition. As a reflection of the hard work you have put into the class, you recieve an A for your final grade, Stellar Job!.
