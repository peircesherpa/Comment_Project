Pre-Calculus is the preparation for Calculus. The course approaches topics from a function point of view, where appropriate, and is designed to strengthen and enhance conceptual understanding and mathematical reasoning used when modeling and solving mathematical and real-world problems. John, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are reflective, adaptable, collaborative. John, you rarely turn in homework, and I think you would benefit from doing the homework because it would help you deepen your understanding of the course material. You work well in small and large groups, I see that you are not afraid to share your ideas infront of the class. John, you show a basic level of understanding, but you definitely have some work to do. Your scores are not very impressive, with C's on most tests, and scoring a 70 on the final. I highly recommend that you stop by my office to do some 1-on-1 meetings with me, as I think you would benefit greatly. Also, if you have any questions, feel free to email me or classmates for help. The jump from Algebra II to Precalc is significant and you have smoothly transitioned. With the work you have put into the this class, you recieve a final grade of B, good job!
