Pre-Calculus is the preparation for Calculus. The course approaches topics from a function point of view, where appropriate, and is designed to strengthen and enhance conceptual understanding and mathematical reasoning used when modeling and solving mathematical and real-world problems. Greta, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are engaged, dedicated, collaborative. Greta, you always turn in homework, and I applaud your dedication to the course! You work very well in small and large groups, I see that you are excited to share your ideas infront of the class. I think you are a stellar example of what participation should look like in class.Greta, you have done very well in this class, scoring A's on most tests, and getting an 94 on the final. You show an extremely high level of skill, and I look forward to seeing how you will progress further. If you are looking for an extra challenge, feel free to stop by my office and ask for some extra practice problems. The jump from Algebra II to Precalc is significant and you have done well in this transition. As a reflection of the hard work you have put into the class, you recieve an A for your final grade, Stellar Job!.
