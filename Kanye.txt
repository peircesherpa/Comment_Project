Pre-Calculus is the preparation for Calculus. The course approaches topics from a function point of view, where appropriate, and is designed to strengthen and enhance conceptual understanding and mathematical reasoning used when modeling and solving mathematical and real-world problems. Kanye, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are reflective, adaptable, collaborative. Kanye, you always turn in homework, and I applaud your dedication to the course! You work very well in small and large groups, I see that you are excited to share your ideas infront of the class. I think you are a stellar example of what participation should look like in class.Kanye, you have shown yourself to be a very competent student, but you still have areas to grow. You have scored B's on most tests, scoring a 85 on the final. You show a good level of understanding, but I would encourage you to come find me if you have any extra questions. The jump from Algebra II to Precalc is significant and you have done well in this transition. As a reflection of the hard work you have put into the class, you recieve an A for your final grade, Stellar Job!.
