AP Calculus AB is an introductory college-level calculus course. Students cultivate their understanding of differential and integral calculus through engaging with real-world problems represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally and using definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions as they explore concepts like change, limits, and the analysis of functions. Corey, from my experience with you, the three words I would use to describe you are engaged, adaptable, independent. Corey, you often turn in homework, and I think you are doing great in this respect. You work better on an individual basis, I see that you are  hesitant to share your ideas infront of the class, but you still have wonderful ideas. You could work on opening up and sharing your great ideas in class . I look forward to seeing your growth in participation.Corey, you have shown yourself to be a very competent student, but you still have areas to grow. You have scored B's on most tests, scoring a 87 on the final. You show a good level of understanding, but I would encourage you to come find me if you have any extra questions. The jump from Precalc to Calc AB is significant and you have done well in this transition. As a reflection of the hard work you have put into the class, you recieve an A for your final grade, Stellar Job!.
